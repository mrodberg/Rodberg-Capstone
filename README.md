Abstract: Estimating the current value of an asset has been an age old issue due to disparity of information, yet the profits one could achieve if they could make such accurate predictions would be unfathomable. So, it follows that tools that can give even a close estimation of current market value have extreme utility to users of all kinds ranging from buyers to speculators to underwriters. To that end, using California housing census data, my model has been able to give predictions on median home value with a high degree of accuracy while identifying key features that contribute to value .
