# Predicting Median Home Price Using Machine Learning
Abstract: Estimating the current value of an asset has been an age old question. No one has been able to absolutely predict the market value of an asset at any given time, with any degree of repeatability, yet the profits one could achieve if they could make such predictions would be unfathomable. So, it follows that tools that can give even a close estimation of current market value have extreme utility to users of all kinds. To that end, using California housing census data, my model has been able to give predictions on median home value with a high degree of accuracy.UPDATE WITH MORE DETAIL ONCE MODEL IS DONE!!
